# Intelligent_system


This repository is the code part of my graduation design.We also did a real system model for it,
We can observe and control the system through any devices(phones,computers,tablet...)which can connect to the Internet,
even if we are thousands miles away.Is that really works? The fact is it was runing well during the term of our graduation design exhibision.


For hardware,We have ESP8266 wifi module with sensors and eletrical control system,web-server and MQTT-server runing on Raspberry pi(a cool toy you deserve to have),and the power system for whole Intelligent system(Do not ignore the power part!)

For the codes:For ESP8266 module, we need to build connetion with pi,receive or send messages from/to pi, collect the sensors data or publish commands
(this part we wrote on Adruino IDE,the programming languages is C/C++ );
For web-server, we built a python web-server which uses Flask--a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja2 and good intentions;
For the webpage, we write it with Javascript,CSS and HTML(This is not my part(-^_^-). 

Okay,that's the simple description of our project.Hope this repository can really help you guys.If you have any ideas or problems,please let me know.


Below are some pictures(sreenshots from my paper) of this systems.
